Introduction to Layers
======================

The following chapter will introduce you with the demonstrator in the form of logical layers.

Conceptually, you can picture the demonstrator as such :

.. |oscied_layers| replace:: The project separated in logical layers, from the servers to the end-user

.. only:: html

    .. figure:: ../schematics/OSCIED-Layers.png
        :width: 800px
        :align: center
        :alt: |oscied_layers|

        |oscied_layers|

.. only:: latex

    .. figure:: ../schematics/OSCIED-Layers.png
        :scale: 100 %
        :alt: |oscied_layers|

        |oscied_layers|

.. raw:: latex
